# Community Chat Feature

## Overview
The community chat feature allows users to communicate in real-time with other logged-in users of the platform. You can send messages in community channels or directly to individual users.

## Fixed Issues
We've resolved several issues with the community chat feature:

1. **Message Sending** - Messages are now properly sent and received in real-time
2. **React Hooks Warning** - Fixed the React Hooks warning by improving the user presence implementation
3. **Error Handling** - Enhanced error handling for more reliable message delivery
4. **User Presence** - Improved user online/offline status detection

## How to Use the Chat

### After Login:
1. Navigate to the Community page from the main menu
2. You'll see:
   - A list of available communities on the left
   - A list of online users on the right
   - The main chat area in the center

### Sending Messages:
1. Click on a community or user to start chatting
2. Type your message in the input field at the bottom
3. Press Enter or click the Send button to send the message
4. You can also send attachments by clicking the paperclip icon

### Technical Notes:
The chat system uses a local storage-based implementation for message storage and an event-based system for real-time updates. In a production environment, this would be replaced with WebSockets or a similar technology.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the chat:

1. **Messages not sending** - Check the browser console for error messages
2. **Users not appearing online** - Try refreshing the page
3. **Message history not loading** - Clear browser cache and reload

## Development

The chat is implemented with the following components:

- `CommunityPage.jsx` - Main page component
- `ChatArea.jsx` - Handles message display and sending
- `UsersList.jsx` - Shows online users
- `GroupsList.jsx` - Shows available communities
- `communityEvents.js` - Manages real-time events
- `communityUtils.js` - Handles community data storage
- `hookFix.js` - Custom hook for proper user presence management
