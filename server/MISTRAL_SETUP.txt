MISTRAL API SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
===========================

To fix the "Could not connect to AI service" or "AI is not working" errors, follow these steps:

1. Create a file named '.env' in the backend directory (or edit if it exists)

2. Add your Mistral API key to the file:
   MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   
   - Get your API key from https://console.mistral.ai/
   - Replace "your_actual_api_key_here" with the key you received

3. Make sure the backend server is running:
   - In PowerShell, navigate to the backend directory: 
     cd backend
   - Run the server:
     node server.js
   
4. In a different PowerShell window, start the frontend:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory:
     cd frontend-starter
   - Run the development server:
     npm run dev

5. If you're still experiencing issues, check:
   - If the API key is valid and correctly formatted
   - If there are any errors in the backend console output
   - Your network connectivity to the Mistral API servers

IMPORTANT: Don't share your API key with anyone. It provides access to your Mistral account and may incur usage charges.
